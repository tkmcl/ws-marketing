- **TenneT (Feb 14, 2026)**: Non-upstream opportunity. Dutch TSO. Michiel requested dashboard mockup for AI-assisted Portfolio Planning pitch. Awaiting Glu's input on design patterns. Proposed concept: Gantt-style timeline + Pareto chart + scenario selector + constraint indicators.

## Market Patterns (Feb 2026)
- **European Majors Buyback Wave**: BP (halted), Equinor (70% cut), TotalEnergies (halved) — all within 10 days. Synchronized capital discipline unprecedented since 2020.
- **Infrastructure-Led Exploration (Feb 16)**: Majors prioritizing tie-backs over greenfield (Azule Algaita, ConocoP Ekofisk). Lower risk, faster monetization — precision growth in action.
- **M&A for Optionality**: Harbour-LLOG, ADNOC fleet expansion, Aramco leasebacks — building resilience through consolidation rather than volume growth.
- **Macro Shift (Feb 16-20)**: Bearish Feb 16-18 (IEA demand cut, supply surplus, Brent dropped to ~$67). Reversed Feb 20: US-Iran tensions pushed oil to 6-month highs (Brent ~$72, WTI ~$66). Geopolitical risk premium returns.
- **Gas as Strategic Bridge (Feb 18)**: Multiple majors positioning gas as transition-resilient. Eni Calao (5 Tcf), Exxon Guyana gas-to-shore, Equinor Gullfaks compression. Content hook for WhiteSpace.

## Outstanding Actions (as of Feb 20, 2026)
- [ ] **TenneT dashboard mockup** — Awaiting Glu's response on WhiteSpace design patterns
- [ ] **Hibiscus contact names** — Needed for personalized outreach drafts
- [ ] **SPE Stavanger/Aker attendee names** — Needed for follow-up emails

## Operational Lessons
- **Account Brief Updates (Feb 16, 2026)**: Every news item from daily scans that relates to a Tier account must be appended to that account's Notion Account Brief page. This builds a per-account knowledge base over time. Format: date header, summary, signal type, region, WhiteSpace angle, source.
- **Morning Protocol**: Each day now begins with a "Marketing Spark" (light marketing lesson) before the news briefing.
- **Syncing**: Keep LinkedIn drafts in `drafts/` and summaries in Notion `Marketing Intel`. Weekly Roundups are saved to `memory/`.
- **Timing**: Reactive drafts for earnings should be ready within 24h of the release.
- **Verification Rule**: Never claim a task is "done" until the specific tool response (e.g., Notion page_id) confirms it. Conflating "triggered" with "completed" is a critical failure.
- **Memory Archival**: Daily files older than 7 days should be moved to `memory/archive/` after key insights are consolidated to MEMORY.md.
