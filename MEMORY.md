## Core Strategic Context (Feb 2026)
- **Primary Market Shift**: Energy majors (Equinor, Shell) are pivoting from volume growth to "precision growth" and capital discipline.
- **Key Narrative**: "Energy for AI" is becoming a critical industry signal (Shell CEO Wael Sawan). Powering 2026 infrastructure requires a move away from legacy planning tools.
- **WhiteSpace Positioning**: Emphasizing "Clarity in Complexity" and "Strategic Planning" as the lever for high-value optimization in a tight-capex environment.

## Content Strategy & Performance
- **Strategic Precision over Volume (Equinor/Shell Feb 2026)**: Industry is shifting from volume growth to "precision growth." High-value optimization is the new priority as capex is tightened.
- **Energy for AI Narrative**: Validated by Shell (CEO Wael Sawan). The link between energy security and AI infrastructure is a key strategic hook for 2026.
- **High Resonance Content**: Linking macro earnings (Equinor capex cuts) to specific planning challenges.
- **Upcoming Hooks**: BP results (Feb 10) are the next major focus for the "Planning survives reality" theme.

## Stakeholder & Account Intel
- **Michiel**: Values speed and "so what" analysis. (See USER.md).
- **Equinor**: Shifting from aggressive capital distribution (70% buyback cut) to strategic discipline. Message: "Doing more with less."
- **Shell**: Validating the energy security/AI boom link.

## Operational Lessons

- **Syncing**: Keep LinkedIn drafts in `drafts/` and summaries in Notion `Marketing Intel`.
- **Timing**: Reactive drafts for earnings should be ready within 24h of the release.
