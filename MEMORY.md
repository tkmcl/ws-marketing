# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory (Ada)

## Core Strategic Context (Feb 2026)
- **Primary Market Shift**: Energy majors (Equinor, Shell) are pivoting from volume growth to "precision growth" and capital discipline.
- **Key Narrative**: "Energy for AI" is becoming a critical industry signal (Shell).
- **WhiteSpace Positioning**: Emphasizing "Clarity in Complexity" and "Strategic Planning" as the lever for high-value optimization in a tight-capex environment.

## Lesson Learned
- **Content Strategy**: Drafts that link macro earnings (Equinor capex cuts) to specific planning challenges resonate better than generic industry news.
- **Reactive Timing**: BP results (Feb 10) are a critical upcoming hook for the "Planning survives reality" theme.

## Stakeholder Highlights
- **Michiel**: Values speed and "so what" analysis. (See USER.md for more).
- **Equinor Messaging**: Focus on "doing more with less" and "capital discipline" as the primary value proposition during their capex contraction.
