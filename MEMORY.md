# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory (Ada)

## Scope
- **Upstream Only (Feb 13, 2026)**: Michiel confirmed focus is exploration, development, and production only. Exclude midstream, downstream, and renewables unless directly impacting upstream planning.

## Core Strategic Context (Feb 2026)
- **Primary Market Shift**: Energy majors (Equinor, Shell) are pivoting from volume growth to "precision growth" and capital discipline. (Source: Weekly Roundup Feb 6, 2026)
- **Key Narrative**: "Energy for AI" is becoming a critical industry signal (Shell CEO Wael Sawan). Powering 2026 infrastructure requires a move away from legacy planning tools.
- **WhiteSpace Positioning**: Emphasizing "Clarity in Complexity" and "Strategic Planning" as the lever for high-value optimization in a tight-capex environment.
- **BP Capital Discipline Escalation (Feb 10-11, 2026)**: Q4 profit $2.3B. Then Feb 11: halted $750M quarterly buybacks, cut 2026 capex to $13-13.5B. Incoming CEO Meg O'Neill (April 2026). Barclays: "story is about rebuilding trust in capital allocation."
- **Shell Resource Gap (Feb 11, 2026)**: CEO Sawan acknowledged 350K-800K boepd gap to 2035, reserve life below 8 years (vs. Exxon/Total at 12+). Not rushing to buy assets, but gap is real.
- **TotalEnergies Capital Discipline (Feb 12, 2026)**: Q4 adjusted net income $3.84B (down 13% YoY). Halved Q1 buybacks to $750M. Full-year range $3-6B maintained. Assuming $60 Brent for 2026. Third European major to cut buybacks in 10 days (BP, Equinor, Total).
- **Libya Licensing Round (Feb 12, 2026)**: First since 2007. Winners: Chevron (Sirte S4), Eni+QatarEnergy (Offshore Area 01), Repsol+MOL+TPOC (Offshore Area 07). Libya targeting 1.6M bpd by end-2026. Signals returning industry confidence.
- **Equinor Portfolio High-Grading (Feb 12, 2026)**: Exiting Vaca Muerta (Argentina) — selling to Vista Energy for ~$1.1B. Retains offshore. Reinforces "precision over volume" thesis.
- **Shell Sprng Energy Review (Feb 13, 2026)**: Reviewing options for $1.55B India renewables unit (2,300 MWp operational). Signals continued retreat from low-carbon under Sawan.
- **Türkiye-BP-Chevron MoUs (Feb 13, 2026)**: TPAO signed strategic cooperation with BP and Chevron. Priority areas: Iraq fields, Libya, Central Asia. Another MoU "expected next week."
- **Argentina LNG JDA (Feb 13, 2026)**: YPF, Eni, and ADNOC's XRG signed binding agreement for 12 mtpa project. FID expected H2 2026. Major South American LNG play.
- **Aramco-Microsoft AI Partnership (Feb 13, 2026)**: Deepening industrial AI partnership on Azure. Focus: operational optimization, data sovereignty, workforce development. Competitive signal for WhiteSpace positioning.
- **IEA Bearish Outlook (Feb 13, 2026)**: 2026 demand growth cut to 850K bpd. Supply surplus of 3.73M bpd projected (~4% of demand). Brent tumbled $1+ on news.

## Content Strategy & Performance
- **Strategic Precision over Volume (Feb 2026)**: Industry is shifting from volume growth to "precision growth." High-value optimization is the new priority as capex is tightened (Validated by Equinor/Shell).
- **Energy for AI Narrative**: Validated by Shell (CEO Wael Sawan). The link between energy security and AI infrastructure is a key strategic hook for 2026.
- **BP Leadership Change (Feb 9-11, 2026)**: CEO Murray Auchincloss stepping down, interim Carol Howle, incoming Meg O'Neill (April 2026). Transition + buyback halt = "rebuilding trust" narrative. Critical stakeholder refresh for WhiteSpace outreach.
- **Equinor $4B Capex Cut (Feb 9, 2026)**: Shift to "high-grading" and precision growth. Messaging hook: "Clarity when trade-offs are mandatory."
- **Palantir Competitive Signal (Feb 9-11, 2026)**: Cognizant partnership (Feb 9) + Daiwa upgrade (Feb 11) on 137% US commercial revenue growth. Repositioning from "AI adoption" to "operating system for business operations." Different market than WhiteSpace, but validates enterprise AI demand.
- **High Resonance Content**: Linking macro earnings (Equinor capex cuts) to specific planning challenges.
- **BP Q4 Results (Feb 10, 2026)**: Delivered. $2.3B profit, $13-15B capex maintained, Carol Howle "staying the course." Content hook activated: "Planning survives reality."
- **Weekly Roundup Delivered (Feb 13, 2026)**: Synthesized BP buyback halt + leadership transition + Equinor capex + Shell resource gap + TotalEnergies buyback cut + Libya licensing into "capital discipline" narrative. Notion: 3061cf93fe6281f8a95bd18849e1574f.
- **Next Focus (Week of Feb 17)**: BP Meg O'Neill transition (April), Shell M&A (Sprng outcome + BP speculation), Equinor precision growth messaging validation.

## Stakeholder & Account Intel
- **Michiel**: Values speed and "so what" analysis. (See USER.md).
- **Equinor**: Shifting from aggressive capital distribution (70% buyback cut) to strategic discipline. Message: "Doing more with less."
- **Shell**: Validating the energy security/AI boom link. Groningen arbitration (Feb 12) signals aggressive asset protection strategy.
- **TotalEnergies**: Third European major to cut buybacks. FIDs planned: Venus (Namibia), Ima (Nigeria), PNG LNG.
- **Libya**: First licensing round since 2007. Tier 1 accounts participating (Chevron, Eni, Repsol). Emerging opportunity.
- **Chevron**: Leviathan gas expansion FID (Feb 11, 2026). Subsea 7 won 17km subsea installation. Greece offshore contracts signed (Feb 16) — 4 blocks with HELLENiQ (~47K km²), first drilling in 40 years. Active project execution mode across multiple frontier regions.
- **ConocoPhillips**: Greater Ekofisk $2B investment (Feb 16) — restart of 3 fields by end-2028. Tier 0 customer with fresh capex signal.
- **Azule Energy (Eni-BP JV)**: 500M barrel Algaita-01 discovery offshore Angola (Feb 16). Tie-back to Olombendo FPSO. Infrastructure-led exploration exemplar.
- **Harbour Energy**: Closed $3.2B LLOG acquisition (Feb 16). Tier 0 customer; M&A integration = planning complexity opportunity.
- **Saudi Aramco**: Jafurah Phase 1 exports began (Feb 16). Microsoft AI partnership deepening (Feb 13). Competitive positioning on industrial AI — WhiteSpace differentiation via planning focus remains intact.
- **ADNOC**: Record 2024 results + LNG fleet expansion announced (Feb 16). Aggressive growth posture.
- **Petronas**: Oman Block 18 award + Malaysia Bid Round 2026 announced (Feb 16). Southeast Asia expansion.
- **TPAO (Türkiye)**: Expanding partnerships with BP/Chevron (Feb 13). Priority: Iraq, Libya, Central Asia. Emerging player to watch.
- **TenneT (Feb 14, 2026)**: Non-upstream opportunity. Dutch TSO. Michiel requested dashboard mockup for AI-assisted Portfolio Planning pitch. Awaiting Glu's input on design patterns. Proposed concept: Gantt-style timeline + Pareto chart + scenario selector + constraint indicators.

## Market Patterns (Feb 2026)
- **European Majors Buyback Wave**: BP (halted), Equinor (70% cut), TotalEnergies (halved) — all within 10 days. Synchronized capital discipline unprecedented since 2020.
- **Infrastructure-Led Exploration (Feb 16)**: Majors prioritizing tie-backs over greenfield (Azule Algaita, ConocoP Ekofisk). Lower risk, faster monetization — precision growth in action.
- **M&A for Optionality**: Harbour-LLOG, ADNOC fleet expansion, Aramco leasebacks — building resilience through consolidation rather than volume growth.
- **Bearish Macro (Feb 16)**: IEA demand growth cut to 850K bpd, 3.73M bpd supply surplus projected (~4% of demand). Brent at ~$67.70, second consecutive weekly drop. Capex discipline reinforced.

## Outstanding Actions (as of Feb 16, 2026)
- [ ] **TenneT dashboard mockup** — Awaiting Glu's response on WhiteSpace design patterns
- [ ] **Hibiscus contact names** — Needed for personalized outreach drafts
- [ ] **SPE Stavanger/Aker attendee names** — Needed for follow-up emails

## Operational Lessons
- **Account Brief Updates (Feb 16, 2026)**: Every news item from daily scans that relates to a Tier account must be appended to that account's Notion Account Brief page. This builds a per-account knowledge base over time. Format: date header, summary, signal type, region, WhiteSpace angle, source.
- **Morning Protocol**: Each day now begins with a "Marketing Spark" (light marketing lesson) before the news briefing.
- **Syncing**: Keep LinkedIn drafts in `drafts/` and summaries in Notion `Marketing Intel`. Weekly Roundups are saved to `memory/`.
- **Timing**: Reactive drafts for earnings should be ready within 24h of the release.
- **Verification Rule**: Never claim a task is "done" until the specific tool response (e.g., Notion page_id) confirms it. Conflating "triggered" with "completed" is a critical failure.
- **Memory Archival**: Daily files older than 7 days should be moved to `memory/archive/` after key insights are consolidated to MEMORY.md.
