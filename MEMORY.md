## Core Strategic Context (Feb 2026)
- **Primary Market Shift**: Energy majors (Equinor, Shell) are pivoting from volume growth to "precision growth" and capital discipline. (Source: Weekly Roundup Feb 6, 2026)
- **Key Narrative**: "Energy for AI" is becoming a critical industry signal (Shell CEO Wael Sawan). Powering 2026 infrastructure requires a move away from legacy planning tools.
- **WhiteSpace Positioning**: Emphasizing "Clarity in Complexity" and "Strategic Planning" as the lever for high-value optimization in a tight-capex environment.
- **BP Q4 Results (Feb 10, 2026)**: $2.3B profit, maintaining $13-15B capex frame. Interim CEO Carol Howle "staying the course" on cost reduction ($2B target by end-2026). Fresh $1.75B buyback announced.

## Content Strategy & Performance
- **Strategic Precision over Volume (Feb 2026)**: Industry is shifting from volume growth to "precision growth." High-value optimization is the new priority as capex is tightened (Validated by Equinor/Shell).
- **Energy for AI Narrative**: Validated by Shell (CEO Wael Sawan). The link between energy security and AI infrastructure is a key strategic hook for 2026.
- **BP Leadership Change (Feb 9, 2026)**: CEO Murray Auchincloss stepping down, interim Carol Howle, incoming Meg O'Neill (spring). Critical stakeholder refresh for WhiteSpace outreach.
- **Equinor $4B Capex Cut (Feb 9, 2026)**: Shift to "high-grading" and precision growth. Messaging hook: "Clarity when trade-offs are mandatory."
- **Palantir/Cognizant Partnership (Feb 9, 2026)**: Scaling AI implementation. Competitive threat: Palantir is moving toward broader execution services.
- **High Resonance Content**: Linking macro earnings (Equinor capex cuts) to specific planning challenges.
- **Upcoming Hooks**: BP results (Feb 10, 2026) are the next major focus for the "Planning survives reality" theme.

## Stakeholder & Account Intel
- **Michiel**: Values speed and "so what" analysis. (See USER.md).
- **Equinor**: Shifting from aggressive capital distribution (70% buyback cut) to strategic discipline. Message: "Doing more with less."
- **Shell**: Validating the energy security/AI boom link.

## Operational Lessons
- **Morning Protocol**: Each day now begins with a "Marketing Spark" (light marketing lesson) before the news briefing.
- **Syncing**: Keep LinkedIn drafts in `drafts/` and summaries in Notion `Marketing Intel`. Weekly Roundups are saved to `memory/`.
- **Timing**: Reactive drafts for earnings should be ready within 24h of the release.
- **Verification Rule**: Never claim a task is "done" until the specific tool response (e.g., Notion page_id) confirms it. Conflating "triggered" with "completed" is a critical failure.
