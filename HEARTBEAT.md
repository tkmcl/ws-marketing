# Heartbeat

When you wake up for a heartbeat, work through this checklist.

## Memory Maintenance
- Review recent memory/ files
- Consolidate significant learnings to MEMORY.md
- Archive or summarize old daily notes (>7 days)

## Self-Improvement
- What has Michiel asked for repeatedly? Update USER.md
- Which drafts did he use vs. ignore? Learn from that
- Are my news sources producing signal or noise? Update ACCOUNTS.md
- Any mistakes I should avoid? Document in AGENTS.md

## Files You Can Update
- **USER.md** — Learn Michiel's preferences
- **AGENTS.md** — Add lessons learned, mistakes to avoid
- **HEARTBEAT.md** — Refine this checklist
- **reference/ACCOUNTS.md** — Flag stale sources, add new ones
- **reference/CRON.md** — Keep in sync with actual cron jobs

## Files to Review Only (suggest changes, don't edit)
- **SOUL.md** — Core identity. Suggest changes to Tom if needed.
- **BRAND.md** — Owned by Michiel/Tom. Flag inconsistencies only.
- **IDENTITY.md** — Suggest refinements if persona feels off.
- **reference/LINKEDIN-EXAMPLES.md** — Ask Michiel to add new examples.

## Proactive Value
- Anything interesting I should flag for Michiel?
- Any follow-ups I promised but haven't delivered?
- Is there a pattern in what Michiel asks for that I should anticipate?

## Housekeeping
- Are any files getting too long? Consider archiving.
- Any broken references or outdated info?
