## WhiteSpace for TenneT: Making Informed Decisions in a Congested Grid

TenneT faces an unprecedented challenge: balancing 9.1+ GW of unlocked capacity against physical constraints, labour shortages, and supply chain bottlenecks — all while offshore build-out races ahead of onshore infrastructure.

**WhiteSpace brings clarity to these trade-offs.**

Our platform doesn't replace your experts' judgment. It **amplifies it** — surfacing the right information at the right moment so decisions can be made with confidence, not guesswork.

### How It Works

| Challenge | What WhiteSpace Enables |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Grid Congestion Relief** | Multi-objective scheduling that balances customer value, grid stability, and revenue. Real-time dispatch optimisation during congested windows. Scenario modelling to see downstream impacts before approving connections. |
| **Project Sequencing** | Crew and contractor allocation across NL and DE. Supply-chain synchronisation for cables and transformers. Delay propagation analysis — when SuedLink slips, see what else moves. |
| **Offshore–Onshore Integration** | Bottleneck identification between offshore generation and onshore capacity. Reinforcement timing aligned with commissioning schedules. Curtailment cost modelling to quantify the price of misalignment. |
| **Dynamic Line Rating Deployment** | ROI-based line ranking to prioritise sensor rollout. Weather correlation analysis (coastal NL vs inland DE). Quick-win identification — unlock up to 30% capacity where it matters most. |

### The Difference: Operational Clarity

Where portfolio tools like Copperleaf excel at strategic CAPEX prioritisation, WhiteSpace operates at the **execution layer** — optimising the daily and weekly decisions that turn strategy into reality.

**TenneT's planners and operators get:**
- Visibility into trade-offs *before* committing resources
- Confidence that today's decision won't create tomorrow's bottleneck
- A shared view across teams — from grid operations to project delivery

## Consider the Difference

| Scenario | Without WhiteSpace | With WhiteSpace |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Substation sequencing** (140 planned) | Teams schedule based on individual project timelines. Labour conflicts surface late. Supply chain delays cascade unpredictably. | Integrated view across all 140 substations. Labour and material constraints visible upfront. Delay impacts modelled before they happen. |
| **Congestion window allocation** | First-come-first-served or manual prioritisation. High-value customers wait alongside low-impact requests. | Multi-objective ranking by customer value, grid impact, and revenue. Limited windows go to highest-value use cases. |
| **DLR sensor rollout** | Deployed based on maintenance schedules or vendor availability. ROI varies wildly by line. | Lines ranked by congestion relief potential and weather profile. Investment concentrated where payback is fastest. |

## Why WhiteSpace

- **Configurable, not custom** — fits TenneT's workflows without 18-month implementation cycles
- **Human-centered design** — planners and operators adopt it because it makes their work easier
- **Proven in energy** — built with deep domain expertise in grid operations, offshore wind, and infrastructure planning

*"Clarity in Complexity."*
