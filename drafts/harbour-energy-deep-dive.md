# Account Deep Dive: Harbour Energy (HBR.L)

## 1. Strategy & Priorities (2026+)
Harbour has shifted from "Integration" to "High-Grade Hubs." Following the successful exit of the Wintershall Dea Transitional Services Agreement in Sept 2025, 2026 is their first year as a fully integrated global independent operator.

### Strategic Priorities
*   **Asset High-Grading**: Aggressive reallocation of capital toward "International Growth Hubs" (Norway, Mexico, Indonesia) while "Harvesting" legacy UKCS assets to fund growth. The Q2 2026 sale of Indonesian assets (Natuna Sea/Tuna) to Prime Group for $215M is a signal of moving away from fragmented assets to consolidated hubs.
*   **Production Targets**: Aiming to sustain >450 kboepd through 2027.
*   **Capital Allocation Philosophy**: "Prudent Growth." 2026 is marked by heavy reinvestment into high-return hubs (Norway) while maintaining a $4-5B cost reduction target by 2027 (inherited from the Wintershall merger synergies).
*   **Digital & AI Approach**: Harbour is moving toward **Integrated Activity Planning (IAP)** to manage their expanded global portfolio. Their "Annual Integrated Planning" and "Work Program & Budget" (WP&B) processes are currently undergoing digitization to resolve the complexity of managing 50+ partners across diverse tax regimes.

## 2. Asset Base & AIM Relevance

| Asset Hub | Status | Operator | AIM Relevance | Strategic Focus (2026+) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Norway (Dvalin Area)** | Growth | **Harbour (55%)** | 🔴 **HIGH** | First gas from Dvalin North expected mid-2026. Drilling planning is active. |
| **Norway (Maria Phase 2)** | Growth | Non-Op | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Project successfully completed/Tie-back planning. |
| **Mexico (Zama)** | Growth | **Harbour (NEW)** | 🔴 **HIGH** | Harbour recently took over operatorship from Pemex. FEED/Design work peak in 2026 ahead of FID. |
| **UK (J-Area / Elgin)** | Harvest | **Harbour** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Focus on infill drilling and efficiency to prolong life; high planning complexity. |
| **UK (Southern North Sea)** | Harvest | **Harbour** | 🟢 **LOW** | Late-life management and decommissioning planning. |
| **Indonesia (Andaman II)** | Growth | **Harbour** | 🔴 **HIGH** | Massive gas potential; planning phases for 2C resources (143 mmboe) are ramping up. |
| **CCS (Viking / Acorn)** | Transition | **Harbour** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Strategic differentiator, but longer-term capex weight. |

## 3. Competitive Tech Footprint
*   **Traditional Stack**: Heavily committed to SLB and Halliburton for subsurface.
*   **Direct Competition**: 
    *   **SLB FDplan**: Used for subsurface/drilling planning.
    *   **Halliburton 360/Compass**: Standard in their legacy UK drilling operations.
*   **The Opportunity**: Harbour lacks an integrated "Strategic Planning" layer that connects the WP&B process to the operational activity calendar—especially for the newly integrated Wintershall assets in Norway where complexity has tripled.

## 4. Entry Hooks for Michiel

1.  **"The Zama Handover"**: *“With Harbour taking the lead at Zama from Pemex, the 2026 engineering and design phase requires a level of planning clarity that legacy spreadsheets won't support. AIM can bridge that gap.”*
2.  **"Dvalin North Countdown"**: *“With mid-2026 first gas approaching for Dvalin North, your drilling and completions team is hitting peak activity. How are you ensuring the Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) stays in sync with the revised 2027 cost-reduction targets?”*
3.  **"WP&B Efficiency"**: *“The Wintershall integration is 'done', but the planning silos usually remain. We see an opportunity to automate the Annual Integrated Planning cycle to meet that $4-5B structural cost reduction target.”*
