# Marketing Intel — Feb 9, 2026

## Daily Scan Summary
A high-signal Monday. The "Big Oil" earnings season has officially transitioned into a strategic pivot phase. Equinor and Shell have set a precedent of "capital discipline over volume," which creates a perfect opening for WhiteSpace's optimization narrative. Meanwhile, BP is in a leadership transition tailspin just 24 hours before their results, and Palantir is aggressively expanding its footprint through major service partnerships.

## 🔴 HIGH SIGNAL — Equinor: Strategic Capex Cut & High-Grading
**What happened:** In its Q4 earnings (Feb 4), Equinor announced a $4B cut to its 2026-2027 capex outlook ($13B for 2026), alongside a 70% reduction in share buybacks. Management explicitly cited "high-grading the portfolio" and "cost/capital discipline" as the new priorities.
**So what:** When capital is tight but production growth is still expected (Equinor grew 6% this quarter), the only lever left is **operational efficiency through superior planning**. WhiteSpace helps "high-grade" by identifying the marginal gains in complex portfolios where manual planning fails.

## 🔴 HIGH SIGNAL — BP: Leadership Vacuum Ahead of Earnings
**What happened:** Just days before its Feb 10 earnings call, BP has confirmed Murray Auchincloss is stepping down immediately (staying as advisor), with Meg O'Neill (ex-Woodside) not taking over until "spring." Carol Howle is interim CEO.
**So what:** Organizational pivots + leadership transitions = planning paralysis. BP's strategy is under intense scrutiny from activists. They need to prove they can deliver "more with less" during this interim period. 
**Action:** Activate Playbook 3 (Sales Enablement) - Account brief for Michiel focused on the Carol Howle/Meg O'Neill transition.

## 🔴 HIGH SIGNAL — Shell: AI & Energy Security Narrative
**What happened:** Shell released its "2026 Energy Security Scenarios," where Wael Sawan explicitly linked the "AI Revolution" to global energy security. Sawan is positioning Shell as the "power behind the AI boom," focusing on dispatchable power and gas.
**So what:** This is a goldmine for WhiteSpace's brand positioning. The narrative has shifted from "Transition" to "AI-Driven Energy Security." 
**Action:** Activate Playbook 2 (Content Activation) - LinkedIn draft linking Shell’s AI-Power narrative to the need for smarter planning infrastructure.

## 🔴 HIGH SIGNAL — Competitor: Palantir x Cognizant Partnership
**What happened:** Palantir (PLTR) announced a deep strategic partnership with Cognizant to industrialize AI-driven modernization in regulated industries. They are effectively scaling their sales and delivery force by 10x through this partnership.
**So what:** Palantir is winning on "speed to value" and "industrial scale." WhiteSpace must differentiate by being the "Precision Specialist" vs. Palantir's "Broad Operating System." We need to win on the complexity of the *math*, not just the scale of the data.
**Action:** Activate Playbook 4 (Competitive Response).

## 🟡 MEDIUM SIGNALS
- **TotalEnergies:** Increased investment ($400M) in LPG/Africa cooking solutions. Interesting ESG/Planning angle for distributed energy, but not an immediate core sales hook.
- **Cognite:** Remaining quiet while Palantir steals the headlines. Potential opportunity to position WhiteSpace as the "Planning layer" moving on top of Cognite's Data Fusion.

## Marketing Spark (Today's Lesson)
*"The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself."* — Peter Drucker. 
**Today's Application:** Equinor just told the world they are cutting $4B in spending. Don't sell them "innovation." Sell them the tool that makes the remaining $13B work twice as hard. Fit the tool to their forced discipline.
