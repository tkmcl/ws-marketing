# ExxonMobil Strategic Research 2026

## 1. Core Strategic Priorities for 2026
*   **Structural Cost Savings:** Reaching the next milestone in their multi-year plan to reduce structural costs (building on the $10B+ already achieved).
*   **Pioneer Integration:** Finalizing the operational integration of Pioneer Natural Resources to maximize Permian synergies.
*   **Global Supply Growth:** Driving production from Guyana and the Permian as primary growth engines.
*   **Low Carbon Solutions:** Scaling the CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) and Lithium businesses.

## 2. Major Capex/Investment Focus
*   **Capital Discipline:** Maintaining annual Capex in the $20-25B range (post-merger).
*   **Guyana Deepwater:** Continued rapid development of the Stabroek block.
*   **Permian Unconventionals:** High-intensity drilling and completions focus in the Delaware and Midland basins.

## 3. Efficiency / Digital / AI Initiatives
*   **Permian Synergy Capture:** Using advanced AI/ML for real-time drilling optimization to extract the $2B annual synergies promised from the Pioneer merger.
*   **Digital Operations:** Standardizing global operational workflows to drive down LOE (Lease Operating Expenses).

## 4. Strategic Hooks for WhiteSpace
*   **Synergy Capture:** The focus on "integration synergies" from Pioneer is a huge hook for **cross-asset planning and standardization**.
*   **Lowering Break-evens:** Exxon's obsession with structural costs matches WhiteSpace's **efficiency and cost-tracking** solutions.
*   **New Energy Planning:** As they scale Lithium and CCS, Exxon faces **new-market planning complexity** where WhiteSpace's strategic modeling can assist.
