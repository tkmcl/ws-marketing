# Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) Strategic Research 2026

## 1. Core Strategic Priorities for 2026
*   **Project Delivery & Cost Efficiency:** Relentless focus on safer operations, higher production, and competitive cost structures.
*   **Digital Twin Expansion:** Scaling AI-powered digital twins across the entire asset base (partnered with Kongsberg Digital).
*   **Energy Transition Integration:** Balancing oil production with solar-thermal EOR and renewable energy projects.
*   **Value Chain Optimization:** Maximizing "In-Country Value" (ICV) through localized digital and service hubs.

## 2. Major Capex/Investment Focus
*   **Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR):** Significant investment in chemical and thermal EOR to maintain production from mature fields.
*   **Natural Gas Hubs:** Expanding gas processing and export facilities to meet Oman's "Vision 2040" targets.
*   **Digital Infrastructure:** Investing in AI leadership and human-centric talent development.

## 3. Efficiency / Digital / AI Initiatives
*   **AI-Powered Digital Twins:** Deployment of twins for real-time asset optimization and predictive maintenance.
*   **Automated Drilling:** Using AI to optimize rig scheduling and drilling parameters in the vast Omani desert fields.

## 4. Strategic Hooks for WhiteSpace
*   **The Digital Twin Hook:** PDO is already "sold" on digital. WhiteSpace can help by **operationalizing the data** from digital twins into actionable strategic plans.
*   **Mature Field Optimization:** With a high focus on EOR, the **planning complexity for reservoir management** is extreme—a perfect fit for WhiteSpace's optimization tools.
*   **Cost Structure Mandate:** Their public priority for "competitive cost structures" is a direct hook for **OpEx reduction and process automation**.
