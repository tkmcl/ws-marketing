# PEMEX Strategic Research 2026

## 1. Core Strategic Priorities for 2026
*   **Energy Self-Sufficiency:** A central pillar is achieving Mexico's independence in fuel production by maximizing refinery throughput.
*   **Production Stabilization:** Targeting 1.794 million bpd for 2026 to reverse structural declines.
*   **Natural Gas Boost:** Increasing gas production to 5 billion cubic feet per day to meet domestic industrial demand.
*   **Debt Management:** Continued focus on cutting debt while maintaining necessary public investment (238 billion pesos in drilling).

## 2. Major Capex/Investment Focus
*   **Refinery Modernization:** Massive focus on completing and optimizing the Dos Bocas refinery and other existing plants.
*   **Drilling Intensity:** 1,058 drilling operations and 970 major repairs planned.
*   **Public Investment:** Heavy reliance on government-backed funding for "strategic projects."

## 3. Efficiency / Digital / AI Initiatives
*   **Operational Recovery:** Digital tools for "major repairs" and asset integrity to keep aging fields productive.
*   **Inventory Management:** Streamlining the supply chain for the 1,000+ planned well operations.

## 4. Strategic Hooks for WhiteSpace
*   **The Production Challenge:** PEMEX's struggle to meet its 2026 goals (1.794 million bpd) creates a need for **asset optimization and recovery planning**.
*   **Execution Complexity:** The scale of the "drilling and repair" program (2,000+ actions) is a massive **logistics and scheduling challenge**. WhiteSpace can focus on "operationalizing the strategy."
*   **Cost Discipline under Debt:** With tight budgets and high debt, PEMEX needs **rigorous capital allocation** to ensure every peso spent contributes to the 2026 goals.
