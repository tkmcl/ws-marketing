# Account Deep Dive: Harbour Energy (HBR.L)

## 1. Strategy & Priorities (2026+)
Harbour has shifted from "Integration" to "High-Grade Hubs." Following the successful exit of the Wintershall Dea Transitional Services Agreement in Sept 2025, 2026 is their first year as a fully integrated global independent operator.

### Strategic Priorities
*   **Asset High-Grading**: Aggressive reallocation of capital toward "International Growth Hubs" (Norway, Mexico, Indonesia) while "Harvesting" legacy UKCS assets. 
*   **Target**: Sustain >450 kboepd through 2027.
*   **Capital Allocation**: "Prudent Growth." Reinvesting into high-return hubs while pursuing a $4-5B structural cost reduction target by 2027 (synergy realization from the Wintershall merger).
*   **Digital/AI Approach**: Actively digitizing the **Work Program & Budget (WP&B)** and **Integrated Activity Planning (IAP)** processes to manage the complexity of 50+ partners across 7+ countries.

## 2. Asset Base & AIM Relevance

| Asset Hub | Status | Operator | AIM Relevance | Strategic Focus (2026+) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mexico (Zama)** | Growth | **Harbour (NEW)** | 🔴 **HIGH** | **Key Entry Hook**: Harbour recently took over operatorship from Pemex. 2026 is the peak FEED/Design phase ahead of FID. |
| **Norway (Dvalin Area)** | Growth | **Harbour (55%)** | 🔴 **HIGH** | Dvalin North first gas expected mid-2026. Drilling planning is active. |
| **Indonesia (Andaman II)** | Growth | **Harbour** | 🔴 **HIGH** | Planning for 2C resources (143 mmboe) is the core growth engine in Asia. |
| **UK (J-Area / Elgin)** | Harvest | **Harbour** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Focus on infill drilling and efficiency; high planning complexity. |
| **Norway (Maria Ph 2)** | Growth | Non-Op | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Project completed; focus on tie-back optimization. |
| **CCS (Viking/Acorn)** | Transition | **Harbour** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Long-term strategic differentiator. |
| **UK (SNS)** | Harvest | **Harbour** | 🟢 **LOW** | Decommissioning planning. |

*Note: Harbour is exiting Natuna Sea/Tuna (Indonesia) in Q2 2026 to focus on higher-margin hubs.*

## 3. Competitive Tech Footprint
*   **Subsurface/Drilling**: SLB (FDplan) and Halliburton (360/Compass) are entrenched.
*   **The Planning Gap**: There is no unified strategic layer connecting the **Work Program & Budget (WP&B)** to the operational calendar. This silo is the primary barrier to hitting their $4-5B cost-reduction target.

## 4. ENTRY HOOKS (Michiel)

1.  **"The Zama Handover"**: *“With Harbour taking the lead at Zama from Pemex, the 2026 engineering phase is critical. AIM provides the planning clarity needed to ensure operatorship success from day one.”*
2.  **"Synergy Realization"**: *“You're chasing $4-5B in structural cost reductions. That won't happen in spreadsheets. We automate the 'what-if' modeling for your Integrated Activity Plan.”*
3.  **"Norway Hub Growth"**: *“Dvalin North hits peak activity this year. We help synchronize your drilling schedule with your 2027 financial targets.”*
