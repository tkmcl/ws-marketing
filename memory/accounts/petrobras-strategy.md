# Petrobras Strategic Research 2026

## 1. Core Strategic Priorities for 2026
*   **2026-2030 Business Plan:** Implementation of the new five-year plan focused on production growth and cost management.
*   **$12 Billion OpEx Savings:** A major initiative to optimize manageable operating expenses between 2025 and 2030.
*   **Production Ramp-up:** Targeting significant production increases from new FPSOs in the Pre-Salt basins.
*   **Energy Transition:** Gradual diversification into low-carbon energy while maximizing the value of oil assets.

## 2. Major Capex/Investment Focus
*   **Revised Capex:** Total investment for 2026-2030 set at $109B, reflecting a more cautious view on Brent prices ($63/bbl assumption).
*   **Pre-Salt Dominance:** Continued heavy investment in Deepwater (Pre-Salt) as the core profit driver.
*   **Gas Supply:** Expansion of gas infrastructure (Rota 3 pipeline) to increase domestic supply by 15%.

## 3. Efficiency / Digital / AI Initiatives
*   **Cost Optimization Measures:** Implementation of measures specifically aimed at "manageable OpEx" through digital transformation.
*   **Strategic Project Execution:** Focus on digital tools to ensure large-scale projects (FPSOs) are delivered on time and budget.

## 4. Strategic Hooks for WhiteSpace
*   **Manageable OpEx Savings:** The $12B savings target is a direct hook for WhiteSpace's **operational efficiency and supply chain optimization** tools.
*   **Price Resilience:** The revision of the plan based on lower Brent price assumptions ($63 vs $77) creates a need for **asset optimization and budget discipline** to maintain dividends.
*   **Complex Project Portfolio:** Managing the rollout of multiple subsea developments and FPSOs concurrently introduces massive **project management and logistics complexity** where WhiteSpace can add value.
