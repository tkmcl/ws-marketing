# Eni Strategic Research 2026

## 1. Core Strategic Priorities for 2026
*   **Distinctive Satellite Model:** Listing or selling stakes in specialized business units (Plenitude, Enilive) to fund upstream growth and transition.
*   **Upstream Production Ramp-up:** Reaching 1.8 million boe/d by 2026, driven by fast-track developments.
*   **Gas and LNG Growth:** Prioritizing new gas discoveries to replace Russian supplies.
*   **Carbon Neutrality by 2050:** Integrating CCS and bio-refining into the core business model.

## 2. Major Capex/Investment Focus
*   **Fast-Track Projects:** Shortening the time-to-market for discoveries (e.g., in Africa and the Middle East).
*   **Transition Assets:** Carbon capture, Plenitude (Renewables), and bio-refineries.
*   **Upstream Core:** Continued investment in Libya, Egypt, and Ivory Coast.

## 3. Efficiency / Digital / AI Initiatives
*   **Fast-Track Engineering:** Using digital engineering and standardization to speed up project delivery.
*   **Operational Intelligence:** AI-driven analytics for subsurface exploration and hub optimization.

## 4. Strategic Hooks for WhiteSpace
*   **The "Satellite" Challenge:** Eni's model of "Satellites" creates unique **portfolio management and carve-out planning** needs.
*   **Time-to-Market Mandate:** Their "fast-track" priority is a direct hook for **efficiency in project planning and execution**.
*   **Gas Hub Optimization:** Eni's focus on new gas hubs in Africa requires complex **integrated field development planning**—a WhiteSpace core competency.
