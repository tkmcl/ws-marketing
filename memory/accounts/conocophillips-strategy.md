# ConocoPhillips Strategic Research 2026

## 1. Core Strategic Priorities for 2026
*   **$1 Billion Cost & Capital Reduction:** A primary mandate for 2026 is driving a $1B improvement in capital and operating costs.
*   **Shareholder Returns:** Commitment to returning 45% of CFO to shareholders.
*   **Permian Dominance:** Accelerating production in the Permian while maintaining high capital efficiency.
*   **LNG Integration:** Completing significant LNG projects to boost free cash flow through 2029.

## 2. Major Capex/Investment Focus
*   **Lower Capex Guidance:** Projecting a decrease in Capex from $12.6B in 2025 to $11.5B in 2026.
*   **Permian Laterals:** Strategy to increase 2-mile+ laterals to 90% of Permian wells by 2026 to drive efficiency.
*   **Global LNG:** Strategic focus on long-cycle LNG projects to diversify revenue.

## 3. Efficiency / Digital / AI Initiatives
*   **Structural Efficiency:** Focus on reducing "adjusted operating costs" through better operational planning and execution.
*   **Drilling Technology:** Using advanced data analytics to support the shift toward longer laterals and higher "days-to-depth" performance.

## 4. Strategic Hooks for WhiteSpace
*   **The $1B Challenge:** The explicit goal of $1B in savings is the perfect hook for WhiteSpace's **asset optimization and efficiency** playbooks.
*   **Planning Complexity in Permian:** The shift to 90% 2-mile laterals increases **drilling & completions (D&C) planning complexity**. WhiteSpace can offer solutions for optimized scheduling and resource allocation.
*   **Free Cash Flow Inflection:** Management's focus on a $7B FCF "inflection" by 2029 requires precise **capital allocation and project oversight**, directly matching WhiteSpace's strategic planning capabilities.
