## 1. Core Strategic Priorities for 2026
*   **$7.5 Billion Savings Program:** Launch of a massive savings initiative (Capex + Opex) over 2026-2030.
*   **Differentiated Energy Growth:** Targeting 4% annual energy growth while balancing oil/gas with power.
*   **Integrated Power:** Scaling the integrated power business as a "third pillar" alongside LNG and Upstream.
*   **Shareholder Returns:** Commitment to a 40%+ payout ratio throughout the cycle.

## 2. Major Capex/Investment Focus
*   **Disciplined Capex:** Guidance reduced to ~$16B in 2026.
*   **LNG Leadership:** Continued expansion in the global LNG market.
*   **Emissions Reduction:** Integrating low-carbon investments into all major Capex projects.

## 3. Efficiency / Digital / AI Initiatives
*   **Cash Savings Focus:** The $7.5B program relies heavily on operational efficiencies and digital transformation of field operations.
*   **Smart Maintenance:** Deployment of predictive digital tools to reduce Opex across the global refinery and upstream footprint.

## 4. Strategic Hooks for WhiteSpace
*   **The $7.5B Savings Program:** This is the primary "North Star" hook. TotalEnergies will be highly receptive to **structural cost reduction and efficiency** solutions.
*   **Multi-Pillar Integration:** Their strategy of being "differentiated" (Oil + Power) creates a complex **capital allocation challenge**. WhiteSpace can help with integrated portfolio planning.
*   **Refining Resilience:** With market skepticism around refining gains, WhiteSpace can offer **downstream optimization and market-linked planning** tools.
