# Perenco Strategic Research 2026

## 1. Core Strategic Priorities for 2026
*   **Asset Optimization:** "Rethinking everything" when taking over mature fields to extend life and improve safety.
*   **Gas-Centric Growth in Africa:** Scaling the $2B Cap Lopez LNG project and other gas infrastructure in Central Africa.
*   **Drilling Campaigns (2025-2026):** Executing intensive drilling in Congo (Tchibouela-Est, Masseko, Emeraude) following 2024 success.
*   **Emissions Reductions:** 50% reduction in flaring by 2030, with 2026 being a peak year for flare-reduction equipment installation.

## 2. Major Capex/Investment Focus
*   **Mature Asset Life Extension:** Low-cost, high-value technical interventions in aging fields.
*   **Integrated LNG Hubs:** Developing regional gas chains to move from oil-only to gas-export.
*   **In-house R&D:** Heavy use of Perenco's own technical services to drive down costs.

## 3. Efficiency / Digital / AI Initiatives
*   **Technical Innovation:** Standardizing "plug-and-play" flare reduction and power generation units.
*   **Lean Operations:** Digital tools focused on "minimalist" field automation suitable for remote Africa operations.

## 4. Strategic Hooks for WhiteSpace
*   **The "Mature Asset" Specialist Hook:** Perenco's strategy is all about **rethinking field economics**. WhiteSpace can offer **rapid asset re-evaluation and optimization** tools.
*   **Complexity in Remote Operations:** Managing intensive drilling in Congo and LNG in Gabon requires **advanced logistics and supply chain synchronization**.
*   **Flaring Targets:** The 50% flare reduction goal provides a hook for **energy efficiency tracking and environmental planning**.
