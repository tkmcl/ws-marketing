# Chevron Strategic Research 2026

## 1. Core Strategic Priorities for 2026
*   **$3-4 Billion Structural Cost Savings:** Aiming for a full run-rate reduction of $3-4B by the end of 2026.
*   **Higher Value, Lower Risk:** Focusing the deep opportunity queue on assets with lower execution risk and higher returns.
*   **Permian Efficiency:** Maintaining the low break-even ($50 Brent) through relentless operational discipline.
*   **Portfolio Rationalization:** Continued divestment of non-core assets to sharpen the focus.

## 2. Major Capex/Investment Focus
*   **Capital Discipline:** Maintaining a firm ceiling on annual Capex.
*   **Permian & TCO:** Balancing the growth in the Permian with the ramp-up of the Future Growth Project (FGP) in Tengiz (Kazakhstan).
*   **Gulf of Mexico:** High-return deepwater tie-backs and hub developments.

## 3. Efficiency / Digital / AI Initiatives
*   **Operational Tech:** Investment in digital field technology to achieve the $3-4B cost target.
*   **Automation:** Leading in automated drilling and standardized facility designs to reduce cycle times.

## 4. Strategic Hooks for WhiteSpace
*   **Cost Efficiency Target:** The 2026 deadline for $3-4B in savings is a prime hook for **asset optimization and digital workflow** implementation.
*   **Execution Risk Mitigation:** Management's focus on "lower execution risk" suggests a need for **better project planning and predictive analytics**—a WhiteSpace sweet spot.
*   **Cash Flow Consistency:** With a $50 Brent breakeven target, WhiteSpace can position itself as a partner in **sustaining low-cost operations** through superior resource planning.
