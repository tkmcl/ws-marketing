   - Infrastructure-led exploration continues

2. **Equinor — Granat Discovery + Gullfaks Subsea Compression**
   - Oil/gas discovery near Gullfaks (1.3-3.8 MMboe)
   - Tie-back to existing infrastructure planned
   - OneSubsea EPC contract for subsea compression upgrade

5. ADNOC exits India Ratnagiri refinery; Aramco seeking new terms
6. Palantir HQ move to Miami; won 15 Dresner innovation awards
7. ConocoPhillips: Alaska drilling "no impact" after rig collapse; $1B cost cut target

- EIA forecasts US production decline 2026→2027
- UK NSTA digital strategy launched

### Patterns

- **Infrastructure-led exploration**: Eni Calao (tie-back to Baleine), Equinor Granat (tie-back to Gullfaks), Exxon Hammerhead (gas-to-shore)
- **Gulf majors capital discipline**: ADNOC/Aramco pullback from India megaproject consistent with European buyback cuts

### Recommended Focus

1. Equinor (Tier 0) — existing customer with fresh discovery + infrastructure investment
2. Eni (Tier 1) — exploration momentum (Calao South + Angola last week)
3. ExxonMobil (Tier 1) — Guyana gas complexity as planning challenge
