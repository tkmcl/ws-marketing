## TenneT Dashboard Mockup Request

Michiel requested a mockup dashboard image for TenneT outreach (AI-assisted Portfolio Planning pitch).

**Action taken:**
- Sent Slack DM to Glu (U09SP3DKH4J, message ID: 1771052944.113629) asking about WhiteSpace dashboard design patterns
- Requested details on: Heineken, Neptune, CNOOC dashboards; Pareto charts; scenario comparison; Gantt views

**Proposed concept (pending Glu's input):**
- Left Panel: Project list color-coded by program (Asset Replacement / Grid Reinforcement / Offshore Integration)
- Center: Gantt-style timeline with dependency lines
- Right Panel: Pareto chart (Cost vs. Risk vs. Timeline)
- Top: Scenario selector
- Bottom: Constraint indicators (workforce, outage windows, equipment)

**Status:** Waiting for Glu's response before creating image.

## Outstanding Items
- [ ] Hibiscus contact names → personalized outreach drafts
- [ ] SPE Stavanger/Aker attendee names → follow-up emails
- [ ] Account-centric Notion pages (awaiting confirmation)
- [ ] TenneT dashboard mockup (awaiting Glu)
