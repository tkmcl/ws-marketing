# Account Brief: Harbour Energy (HBR.L) Deep Dive

## Strategy & Priorities (2026+)
Harbour has shifted from "Integration" to "High-Grade Hubs." Following the successful exit of the Wintershall Dea Transitional Services Agreement in Sept 2025, 2026 is their first year as a fully integrated global independent operator.

### Strategic Priorities
*   **Asset High-Grading**: Aggressive reallocation of capital toward "International Growth Hubs" (Norway, Mexico, Indonesia) while "Harvesting" legacy UKCS assets to fund growth. The Q2 2026 sale of Indonesian assets (Natuna Sea/Tuna) to Prime Group for $215M is a signal of moving away from fragmented assets to consolidated hubs.
*   **Production Targets**: Aiming to sustain >450 kboepd through 2027.
*   **Capital Allocation Philosophy**: "Prudent Growth." 2026 is marked by heavy reinvestment into high-return hubs (Norway) while maintaining a $4-5B cost reduction target by 2027 (inherited from the Wintershall merger synergies).
*   **Digital & AI Approach**: Harbour is moving toward **Integrated Activity Planning (IAP)** to manage their expanded global portfolio. Their "Annual Integrated Planning" and "Work Program & Budget" (WP&B) processes are currently undergoing digitization to resolve the complexity of managing 50+ partners across diverse tax regimes.

## Asset Base & AIM Relevance

### Hub: Norway (Central/Northern Sea)
*   **Dvalin Area (Operated - 55%)**: 🔴 **HIGH RELEVANCE**. Dvalin North first gas expected mid-2026. Drilling planning is active.
*   **Maria Phase 2 (Non-Op)**: 🟡 **MEDIUM RELEVANCE**. Tie-back planning and production optimization.

### Hub: Mexico
*   **Zama (Operated - NEW)**: 🔴 **HIGH RELEVANCE**. Harbour was appointed operator (taking over from Pemex) at the end of 2025. 2026 is critical for engineering/design ahead of FID.

### Hub: UK
*   **J-Area / Elgin-Franklin (Operated)**: 🟡 **MEDIUM RELEVANCE**. Focus on infill drilling to prolong life; high planning complexity across aging assets.
*   **Southern North Sea (SNS)**: 🟢 **LOW RELEVANCE**. Late-life management and decommissioning planning.

### Hub: Southeast Asia
*   **Andaman II (Operated)**: 🔴 **HIGH RELEVANCE**. Major gas discovery; planning for 2C resources (143 mmboe) is the core growth engine in Asia.

## Competitive Tech Footprint & Gaps
*   **Traditional Subsurface**: SLB (FDplan) and Halliburton (360/Compass) are entrenched in drilling and technical planning.
*   **The Planning Gap**: While they have technical tools, they lack a unified strategic layer to connect the **Work Program & Budget (WP&B)** directly to operational execution. The current $4-5B cost reduction goal requires high-fidelity "what-if" planning that legacy subsurface tools don't address.

## Entry Hooks for Michiel

1.  **"The Zama Operatorship"**: *“With Harbour taking the lead at Zama from Pemex, the 2026 design phase is where project value is either locked in or lost. How are you ensuring your strategic planning models can handle the new operatorship complexity?”*
2.  **"Synergy Realization"**: *“You're targeting $4-5B in structural cost reductions by 2027. Most of that is won or lost in the Integrated Activity Planning (IAP) cycle. Is your current stack providing the 'what-if' flexibility needed to hit those targets?”*
3.  **"Norway Growth"**: *“With Dvalin North ramping up for mid-2026, the delta between your plan and your execution is your biggest cost driver. We help close that gap.”*
