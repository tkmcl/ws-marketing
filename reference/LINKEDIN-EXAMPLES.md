## EXAMPLE 1

AI doesn’t create value by being impressive.
It creates value by being applied with care.

This example from Equinor shows what happens when advanced algorithms are embedded directly into real decision-making: USD 130 million saved by applying AI to optimize operations—supporting better choices, faster, in high-stakes environments.

As Hege Skryseth highlights, digital transformation only matters when it delivers measurable impact. Not hype. Not dashboards. Real outcomes.

That’s a belief we share at WhiteSpace.
AI should:
- Make complexity clearer, not louder
- Elevate human judgment, not replace it
- Be designed for adoption, trust, and day-to-day decisions

When algorithms, domain insight, and a deeply human interface come together, teams move from reacting… to deciding with confidence.

Clarity in complexity—by design.


## EXAMPLE 2

Is your Field Development Planning still stuck in the 20th century? Decisions worth hundreds of millions are too often based on manual, incomplete analyses that leave value on the table.

At WhiteSpace, we bring clarity to complexity—pairing advanced algorithms with a deeply human interface that elevates judgment rather than replacing it.

- Explore every option: Hundreds of thousands of scenarios evaluated in minutes.
- See trade-offs clearly: Intuitive, human-centered tools for confident “what-if” decisions.
- Break free from legacy tools: Reduce cognitive load, move faster, and reclaim value lost to “business as usual.”

Because the future won’t belong to the fastest or the cheapest—
but to those who care enough to get it right.


## EXAMPLE 3

Carbon capture is scaling fast. Decision risk is scaling even faster.
700+ CCS projects are now in development. And with stacked uncertainties—from capture rates to policy shifts—many leaders are asking:

How do we make high-quality decisions when so much is still in flux?

Our latest piece explores how scenario modeling helps CCS projects stay credible, resilient, and ready for what’s next.

Because when uncertainty stacks, care about decisions is the only strategy that scales.


## EXAMPLE 4

Planning is broken — but not beyond repair.

Spreadsheets, slide decks, siloed tools… they all slow teams down.
We believe decision makers need clarity and confidence to feel in control of critical decisions.

In our latest article, we explore:
- Why traditional planning fails
- How AI can elevate human judgment
- What a better way actually looks like — in energy, logistics, and healthcare

It’s time to rebuild planning so that we move from complexity to clarity.
