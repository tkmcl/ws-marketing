# Competitive Analysis: Digital Field Development & Well Planning Solutions

*Source: Michiel's briefing, Feb 14, 2026*

## 1. SLB FDPlan (Agile Field Development Planning)

**Overview:** Cloud-based field development planning on Delfi™ platform. End-to-end planning from subsurface to drilling to facilities. "Agile" = rapid, iterative scenario evaluation.

**Key Features:**
- **Integrated Data & Models:** Aggregates geology, reservoir, wells, facilities, economics. Connects to Intersect, Pipesim, plus third-party (Petex, Quorum)
- **Advanced Computational Engines:** Real-time simulations for production forecasting, reservoir performance, economics, risk. Explore more alternatives with less manual effort
- **Automated Concept Generation (AI-Driven):** FDPlan Concept Generator auto-generates field layouts — "hundreds of development concepts in mere minutes" optimizing well placement, trajectories, facilities, pipelines. Traditionally months → now minutes
- **Collaboration & Agility:** Cross-discipline collaboration, concurrent iteration. Faster time to first oil, higher-confidence FID

**Positioning:** Engineering execution powerhouse. Strong subsurface-to-surface integration. AI for concept generation speed.

## 2. Halliburton Landmark & DecisionSpace 365

**Overview:** DS365 is Halliburton's cloud E&P platform (iEnergy Cloud, OSDU-compliant). Full suite: subsurface modeling, well planning/construction, production, asset management.

**Key Features:**
- **Full Lifecycle Coverage:** Well Construction suite (Digital Well Program) + Geoscience suite. Single platform from exploration through production optimization
- **Cloud Collaboration:** "Digital twin of well construction process" — contractors, service providers, operators share same data/models
- **AI/Analytics and Automation:** Predictive drilling analytics, hazard detection, automated engineering calculations. SmartDigital® co-innovation services (custom AI models per client — e.g., Repsol)
- **Open Architecture:** OSDU-based, third-party integrations. "Open and agnostic platform"

**Use Cases:** Standardizing/streamlining well design workflows. Automate routine tasks, enforce best practices. Resoptima acquisition (2023) = ensemble modeling for rapid subsurface scenarios.

**Positioning:** Operational excellence and well execution. Open architecture play. Competing more directly with SLB on subsurface.

## Market Positioning Task

**Objective:** Develop WhiteSpace market positioning for 3 personas:
1. **Executives** (C-suite, VP-level decision makers)
2. **Users** (Engineers, planners, technical staff)
3. **Digital Leads** (IT/Digital transformation leads, CDOs)

**Next Step:** Collaborate with Glu to develop positioning framework based on competitive differentiation.
