# Account-Based Marketing (ABM) Guidelines

This file contains WhiteSpace's ABM strategy, combining internal best practices with frameworks from FullFunnel.io and strategic energy industry intel.

## 1. The ABM Pillars (The "So-What" Filter)
All ABM activities must pass the **Commercial Action Test**: "What has changed in the account that justifies WhiteSpace's intervention right now?"

### ABM Tiers & Strategy
*   **Tier 0: 1-to-1 (Retention & Expansion)**
    *   **Focus**: Existing AIM customers (Equinor, Harbour, etc.)
    *   **Approach**: Bespoke solution mapping. Quarterly "Strategy Alignment" calls.
    *   **Hook**: Organizational shifts or new "Speed/Efficiency" mandates.
*   **Tier 1: 1-to-Few (Strategic Prospecting)**
    *   **Focus**: High-value acquisition (Shell, BP, Exxon).
    *   **Approach**: Account-specific "Personalized Solutions" docs. Peer-to-peer debriefs.
    *   **Hook**: CAPEX pivots, earnings call keywords, leadership refreshes.
*   **Tier 2: 1-to-Many (Awareness)**
    *   **Focus**: Brand presence & building the "Awareness threshold."
    *   **Approach**: Industry-specific thought leadership. LinkedIn engagement.

## 2. Outreach Workflow: The Research Cascade
Before drafting outreach for a Tier 0/1 account, I will follow this cascade:
1.  **Identify Triggers**: Pull insights from Earnings Calls, Press Releases, or Upstream Online.
2.  **Map the Committee**:
    *   **Champions**: Who handles the "how"? (e.g., Digital Transformation leads)
    *   **Decision Makers**: Who signs for the outcome? (e.g., VP Planning, CEO)
    *   **Influencers**: Technical leads or strategy analysts.
3.  **Value Mapping**: Connect the WhiteSpace value prop directly to *inner* KPIs (e.g., reducing "discovery-to-production" time).

## 3. High-Impact "Warm-up" Plays
*   **Content Co-creation**: Invite a Tier 1 stakeholder to contribute a quote or insight for a WhiteSpace whitepaper (Target 70% reply rate).
*   **The "Micro-Workshop"**: Propose a 15-min "Clarity Session" focused on a specific public challenge mentioned by their CEO.
*   **The "Personalized Solution" Doc**: A 1-page PDF showing exactly how WhiteSpace solves a specific project complexity (e.g., "Namibia Frontier Planning").

---

## 4. Messaging Best Practices
*   **ALWAYS**: Lead with the business outcome (e.g., "We saw your goal to hit 300% efficiency on the NCS...").
*   **ALWAYS**: Reference a specific project or public statement.
*   **NEVER**: Send generic "intro" emails or feature lists.
*   **NEVER**: Reach out to "Decision Makers" without first engaging with "Champions" or building social awareness.

---

## 5. Qualification / Disqualification Criteria
*   **Good Fit**: Long sales cycle (>180 days), complex buying committee (3+ people), High ACV (>$50k).
*   **Red Flags (Disqualify)**: Massive layoffs in the last 6 months, stale funding, new CFO in their first month (usually budget freezes).

---

## 6. Success Indicators (Leading Metrics)
Since the sales cycle is long, we track:
1.  **# of Engaged Accounts**: (Replied/Interested)
2.  **# of Strategy Sessions Booked**.
3.  **Pipeline Velocity**: (Days from Signal to SQO).
