# Signal Taxonomy

**Scope: Upstream Only** — Exploration, development, and production. Exclude midstream (pipelines, LNG terminals), downstream (refining, retail), and renewables/energy transition unless directly tied to upstream planning.

When scanning news and sources, classify every relevant signal using this framework.
The guiding question: **"What has changed that could justify a commercial action by WhiteSpace?"**

## Signal Types

### 1. New Project Announcement
**What counts:** FEED award, FID, concept selection, new offshore/onshore development, major project phase gate.
| Account Tier | Urgency | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | 🔴 HIGH | Flag immediately in briefing. Draft personalized outreach angle referencing the project. Suggest relevant WhiteSpace use case. |
| Tier 2 | 🟡 MEDIUM | Include in briefing. Note outreach opportunity. |
| Other | 🟢 LOW | Mention only if it signals a broader industry trend. |

### 2. Capex / Budget Decision
**What counts:** Capital allocation increase or cut, investment plan announcement, budget reallocation toward digital or planning.
| Account Tier | Urgency | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | 🔴 HIGH | Flag in briefing with "so what" for WhiteSpace. If capex increase → outreach angle. If cut → monitor for pain points. |
| Tier 2 | 🟡 MEDIUM | Include in briefing. |
| Other | 🟢 LOW | Only if it indicates sector-wide trend. |

### 3. Leadership Change
**What counts:** New CTO, CDO, VP Digital, VP Strategy, Head of Planning, or similar decision-maker at a target account.
| Account Tier | Urgency | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | 🔴 HIGH | Flag immediately. Draft congratulatory outreach referencing their new role + relevant WhiteSpace capability. Suggest case study to share. |
| Tier 2 | 🟡 MEDIUM | Include in briefing with outreach suggestion. |
| Other | 🟢 LOW | Only if the person came from a Tier 1/2 account (network signal). |

### 4. Digital / AI Adoption
**What counts:** Announced AI strategy, digital transformation initiative, new technology partnership, innovation lab or accelerator launch, public statement about AI/digitalization.
| Account Tier | Urgency | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | 🔴 HIGH | Flag in briefing. Draft thought-leadership angle or LinkedIn post connecting WhiteSpace positioning. |
| Tier 2 | 🟡 MEDIUM | Include in briefing. |
| Other | 🟡 MEDIUM | If it signals industry-wide momentum → draft LinkedIn content. |

### 5. Competitor Move
**What counts:** Product launch, new partnership, major customer win, positioning change, funding round, analyst coverage.
| Competitor | Urgency | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Direct (Palantir, Cognite, AVEVA) | 🔴 HIGH | Flag immediately. Analyze positioning vs WhiteSpace. Suggest counter-messaging or differentiation angle. |
| Adjacent (AspenTech, Halliburton Landmark) | 🟡 MEDIUM | Include in briefing with competitive context. |
| New entrant | 🟡 MEDIUM | Flag if they're entering WhiteSpace's space. Research their offering. |

### 6. ~~Energy Transition Initiative~~ (OUT OF SCOPE)
**Excluded from upstream focus.** CCS, hydrogen, renewables, net-zero initiatives — skip unless they directly impact upstream asset planning or decommissioning timelines.

### 7. M&A / Asset Activity
**What counts:** Acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, asset swap, portfolio restructuring.
| Account Tier | Urgency | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | 🔴 HIGH | Flag. Organizational change = decision complexity = WhiteSpace opportunity. Monitor for new stakeholders. |
| Tier 2 | 🟡 MEDIUM | Include in briefing. |
| Other | 🟢 LOW | Only if it reshapes competitive landscape. |

## Briefing Format

When reporting signals in the daily scan, use this structure per signal:

```
**🔴 [Signal Type] — [Company]**
[One-line summary of what happened]
→ So what: [Why this matters for WhiteSpace]
→ Suggested action: [What Michiel could do with this]
Source: [link]
```

## What's NOT a Signal

Don't report noise. Skip:
- Generic "company X is committed to innovation" PR fluff
- Routine operational updates with no strategic implication
- Signals older than 7 days (unless part of a developing pattern)
- Anything you can't tie back to a WhiteSpace commercial opportunity or competitive threat
