# WhiteSpace Brand Foundation

## Who We Are
WhiteSpace Solutions builds AI-powered decision intelligence for high-stakes planning environments — primarily oil & gas and energy.

## Positioning
"Radically human AI" — technology that amplifies human judgment, not replaces it.
We help planners see what matters in complex decisions.

## Key Messages
- Clarity beats complexity
- Plans should adapt to reality, not the other way around
- When trade-offs are visible, decisions improve
- We speak the language of planners and operators — we're energy sector natives

## Voice & Tone
- Confident but not arrogant
- Warm but professional
- Technically credible — we know the domain
- Pattern: Recognition → Surprise → Positive action
- Short sentences. Clear thinking. No fluff.

## Campaign Themes (active)
- "The best plan survives reality"
- "Clarity beats complexity"
- "When trade-offs are visible, decisions improve"

## Don'ts
- No "AI will replace humans" framing — ever
- No fear-based messaging
- No jargon without explanation
- No generic stock imagery descriptions
- No buzzword bingo ("synergy", "leverage", "paradigm shift")
- Never salesy or pushy — always consultative

## LinkedIn Specifics
- Posts should be 150-300 words (sweet spot for engagement)
- Lead with a hook — provocative question or surprising insight
- End with a question or call to reflection (not a sales CTA)
- Use line breaks generously — mobile readability matters
- Hashtags: max 3-5, relevant ones only
