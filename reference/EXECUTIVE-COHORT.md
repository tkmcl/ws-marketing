4. Aggregate patterns and outliers

**Diversity dimensions covered:**
- Company type: IOC, NOC, independent, PE-backed, state-adjacent
- Geography: Europe, US, Middle East, LatAm, Africa, Asia
- Background: Engineering, finance, operations, M&A, geoscience, politics
- Pressure: Exit, activism, sovereignty, growth, decline
- Scale: Supermajor → frontier explorer

## Cohort Response Template

When running a cohort test, each persona responds with:

1. **First Reaction** (gut response in 1-2 sentences)
2. **What Resonates** (what works for this persona)
3. **What Falls Flat** (what doesn't land or raises skepticism)
4. **Key Objection** (the question they'd ask)
5. **Interest Level** (🔴 Low / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 High)

---

## Aggregation Framework

After collecting individual responses, synthesize:

- **Consensus points** — What landed across all/most personas?
- **Polarizing points** — What worked for some but not others?
- **Universal objections** — What concern came up repeatedly?
- **Segment patterns** — Did IOC vs. independent vs. NOC respond differently?
- **Recommended revisions** — Based on feedback, what should change?
